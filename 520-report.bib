display of relationships among objects. Much of this information can be
represented by networks with nodes corresponding to objects and links
representing their relationships. Node and link diagrams, although
natural choices to display this class of data, are easily overwhelmed
with too much information, becoming cluttered and visually confused.
Three solutions help solve the information overload problem: (1)
parameter focusing and dynamic interaction, (2) clever node positioning
to show structure, and (3) 3D embeddings. Bell Laboratories' SeeNet,
NicheWorks and SeeNet3D systems embody these techniques. The company has
successfully exercised them to visualize data from several
industrial-sized network data sets}},

@article{Becker_1995,
    abstract = {{Networks are critical to modern society, and a thorough
understanding of how they behave is crucial to their efficient
operation. Fortunately, data on networks is plentiful; by visualizing
this data, it is possible to greatly improve our understanding. Our
focus is on visualizing the data associated with a network and not on
simply visualizing the structure of the network itself. We begin with
three static network displays; two of these use geographical
relationships, while the third is a matrix arrangement that gives equal
emphasis to all network links. Static displays can be swamped with large
amounts of data; hence we introduce direct manipulation techniques that
permit the graphs to continue to reveal relationships in the context of
much more data. In effect, the static displays are parameterized so that
interesting views may easily be discovered interactively. The software
to carry out this network visualization is called SeeNet}},

    abstract = {{Looks at how developers are going back to the future by building Web applications using Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML), a set of technologies mostly developed in the 1990s. A key advantage of Ajax applications is that they look and act more like desktop applications. Proponents argue that Ajax applications perform better than traditional Web programs. As an example, Ajax applications can add or retrieve new data for a page it is working with and the page will update immediately without reloading.}},

@inproceedings{Wood_2008,
    abstract = {{Service-oriented architectures are increasingly being used as the architectural style for creating large distributed computer applications. This paper examines the provision of visualization as a service that can be made available to application designers in order to combine with other services. We develop a three-layer architecture: a client layer which provides the user interface; a stateful Web service middleware layer which provides a published interface to the visualization system; and finally, a visualization component layer which provides the core functionality of visualization techniques. This separation of middleware from the visualization components is crucial: it allows us to exploit the strengths of Web service technologies in providing standardized access to the system, and in maintaining state information throughout a session, but also gives us the freedom to build our visualization layer in an efficient and flexible way without the constraints of Web service protocols. We describe the design of a visualization service based on this architecture, and illustrate one aspect of the work by re-visiting an early example of Web-based visualization.}},
